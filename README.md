Commodore Amiga 4000 Rev.B PCB replica

This Eagle board-file has been generated in the early days of amigapcb.org from the polygon database for debugging and verification purposes. The export in its current state is not suitable for PCB manufacturing due to various issues, such as possibly wrong pad sizes or via diameters. A lot of work is probably required to get this board ready for production, but this should be a good starting point.

The board file is released to the public under the terms of the GNU GPL v3 (or later). A short copyright notice and reference to amigapcb.org has been added to the SILKTOP layer, please keep this notice intact when manufacturing any PCBs.
